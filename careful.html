<!-- The browser will evaluate the HTML document from top to bottom. If JavaScript files or scripts
precede HTML body content, the browser will not render any of the body until the javascripts have
been evaluated. The result of this is that a user might have to wait an unacceptable amount of time
for their content to show. For this reason it is preferred to put javascripts of all kinds below
the HTML body content if possible. -->

$("ul.cool-things > li").attr("style", "background-color: red");
// does nothing; no such ul exists yet.
